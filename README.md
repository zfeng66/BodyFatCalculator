## Group Members
Mengqi Li, Xiangyu Wang, Yiqun Xiao, and Zijun Feng

## Goal
In this project, our goal is to come up with a simple, robust, and accurate "rule-of-thumb" to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurements. The statistical model is based on a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.

## Contents:
-	a **data** folder containing the raw and cleaned data
-	a **code** folder containing all the code for analysis
-	an **image** folder containing any figures/images/tables produced in analysis.
- a two-page executive **summary** `pdf` file
